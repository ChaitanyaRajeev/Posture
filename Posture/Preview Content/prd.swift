 # Posture App Project Structure

 ```
 Posture/
 ├── PostureApp.swift          # Main app entry point
 ├── AppDelegate.swift         # Menu bar and app lifecycle management
 ├── BluetoothManager.swift    # AirPods connection and motion tracking
 ├── ContentView.swift         # Not needed anymore (menu bar only)
 └── Info.plist               # App permissions and configuration

 Optional Test Folders:
 ├── PostureTests/            # Unit tests
 └── PostureUITests/          # UI tests
 ```

 ## Core Files and Their Responsibilities:

 1. **PostureApp.swift**
 ```swift
 @main
 struct PostureApp: App {
     @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate
     
     var body: some Scene {
         Settings { }  // Minimal scene since we're menu bar only
     }
 }
 ```
 - Entry point of the application
 - Initializes the AppDelegate
 - Configures the app as menu bar only

 2. **AppDelegate.swift**
 - Manages the menu bar interface
 - Handles notifications
 - Core responsibilities:
   * Menu bar icon management
   * Menu creation and updates
   * Timer management for posture alerts
   * Notification handling
   * Communication with BluetoothManager
   * User interaction handling

 3. **BluetoothManager.swift**
 - Handles all AirPods-related functionality
 - Core responsibilities:
   * AirPods connection management
   * Motion data processing
   * Posture angle calculations
   * Calibration logic
   * Real-time updates
   * State management

 4. **Info.plist**
 Required permissions:
 ```xml
 <dict>
     <!-- Bluetooth permissions -->
     <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need Bluetooth access to connect to your AirPods for posture monitoring.</string>
     
     <!-- Motion usage permission -->
     <key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need to access motion data to monitor your neck posture.</string>
     
     <!-- Notification permission -->
     <key>NSUserNotificationAlertStyle</key>
     <string>alert</string>
 </dict>
 ```

 ## Data Flow:

 ```
 [AirPods] → BluetoothManager → AppDelegate → Menu Bar UI
      ↓            ↓              ↓
 Motion Data → Angle Calculation → UI Updates
                   ↓              ↓
              Calibration → Notifications/Alerts
 ```

 ## Key Components and Their Interaction:

 1. **Motion Tracking Pipeline:**
 ```
 AirPods → Raw Motion Data → Calibration → Angle Calculation → Posture Assessment
 ```

 2. **UI Update Flow:**
 ```
 Angle Data → AppDelegate → Menu Bar Updates → Visual Feedback
 ```

 3. **Notification System:**
 ```
 Poor Posture Detected → Timer Started → Notification Triggered
 ```

 ## Important Classes:

 1. **BluetoothManager:**
 ```swift
 class BluetoothManager: NSObject, ObservableObject {
     // Motion tracking
     private var headTracker: CMHeadphoneMotionManager?
     
     // Calibration
     private var baselineAngle: Double?
     private var calibrationValues: [Double] = []
     
     // Published states
     @Published var isConnected = false
     @Published var currentNeckAngle: Double = 0.0
     @Published var connectionStatus: String = "Ready"
 }
 ```

 2. **AppDelegate:**
 ```swift
 class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
     // Menu items
     private var statusItem: NSStatusItem!
     private var startStopItem: NSMenuItem!
     
     // State management
     private var bluetoothManager: BluetoothManager!
     private var badPostureTimer: Timer?
 }
 ```

 ## Configuration Requirements:

 1. **Project Settings:**
    - Capabilities:
      * Bluetooth
      * Push Notifications
      * Background Modes (if needed)

 2. **Build Settings:**
    - Deployment Target: macOS 11.0+
    - Swift Language Version: 5.0
    - Enable App Sandbox: Yes

 ## Development Workflow:

 1. **Starting Development:**
    ```bash
    open Posture.xcodeproj
    ```

 2. **Building:**
    - Command + B to build
    - Command + R to run

 3. **Testing:**
    ```swift
    // Run tests using:
    Command + U
    ```

 ## Common Development Tasks:

 1. **Adding New Features:**
    - Modify AppDelegate for UI changes
    - Update BluetoothManager for motion tracking changes
    - Update Info.plist for new permissions

 2. **Debugging:**
    - Use print statements in BluetoothManager for angle data
    - Check menu bar updates in AppDelegate
    - Monitor notification triggers

 3. **Testing:**
    - Test angle calculations
    - Verify notification timing
    - Check calibration accuracy

 Would you like me to:
 1. Explain any specific part in more detail?
 2. Add more information about a particular component?
 3. Provide guidance on implementing specific features?
 4. Show how to add new functionality to the existing structure?

 /**
  # Neck Posture Monitor
  
  An innovative macOS application that helps users maintain healthy neck posture
  while working at their computer. The app leverages AirPods' built-in motion
  sensors to provide real-time posture monitoring and feedback.
  
  ## Core Features
  - Real-time neck posture monitoring using AirPods sensors
  - Menu bar integration for non-intrusive feedback
  - Smart calibration system for personalized posture tracking
  - Timely notifications for posture correction
  - Visual feedback through menu bar icon colors
  
  ## Technical Implementation
  The app uses:
  - CoreMotion for AirPods motion data
  - CoreBluetooth for AirPods connectivity
  - macOS menu bar API for UI
  - UserNotifications for alerts

 /**
  Core class responsible for AirPods integration and motion processing.
  
  This manager handles:
  - AirPods connection and monitoring
  - Motion data processing from AirPods sensors
  - Neck angle calculations and calibration
  - Real-time posture status updates
  
  The angle calculation process:
  1. Establishes baseline during calibration (user's natural position)
  2. Calculates deviation from baseline
  3. Applies smoothing for stable readings
  4. Provides real-time angle updates

    - Green: Good posture
    - Red: Poor posture detected
    - Notifications will remind you to adjust if needed
  
  4. Adjustments:
    - Recalibrate any time through the menu
    - Adjust posture when prompted
    - Check detailed angles in the dropdown menu
